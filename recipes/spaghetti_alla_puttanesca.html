    <h2>This dish cured Okuyasu's problem</h2>
    <p>
      In this page we will discuss Tonio's magical dish that cured Okuyasu's
      health issues (this was certainly all because of the dish and not because
      of Tonio's stand ability ;) )
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Black olives</li>
      <li>Anchovies</li>
      <li>Spaghetti</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Capers</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Chilli flakes</li>
      <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>Fresh basil and oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sauté aromatics</li>
      <p>
        Start off by sautéing the garlic in olive oil until it starts to go
        golden on the edges. Then add the finely chopped anchovies, capers,
        olives and red pepper flakes and cook for a further 1 minute. This
        sautéing step is key to the flavour of the sauce. It blooms the flavour
        of the red pepper flakes and even more importantly, takes the raw fishy
        edge off the anchovies while causing them to break down, ready to
        dissolve into the sauce.
      </p>
      <li>Add everything else into sauce</li>
      <p>
        Add the can of tomatoes, then add water by rinsing out the can. In goes
        salt, pepper and fresh or dried oregano, then give it a good stir.
      </p>
      <li>Simmer 10 minutes</li>
      <p>
        Once the sauce comes to a simmer, turn the heat way down to low and let
        it simmer gently, stirring every now and then, for 10 minutes while the
        pasta cooks. The tomato will break down, the water will cook out,
        leaving behind a nice, shiny and thickened sauce. If at any stage it
        looks like the sauce is drying out (probably due to heat being too
        strong or using a skillet that’s too large), just add a splash of water.
      </p>
      <li>Cook pasta</li>
      <p>
        Cook the pasta in salted water. Just before draining, scoop out a mugful
        of pasta cooking water. This is a key, essential step for cooking any
        pasta (well and properly!). We add a splash into the pasta sauce when
        tossing with the pasta. Starch that’s left in the cooking water helps
        emulsify the fats and water in the sauce. This has a thickening effect
        and also discourages the sauce from separating. The sauce clings
        deliciously to the pasta strands instead of leaving a watery pool of
        bland liquid at the bottom of your pasta bowl.
      </p>
      <li>Combine pasta, sauce and pasta cooking water</li>
      <p>
        After draining the pasta, immediately throw into the sauce along with
        about 1/4 cup of pasta cooking water. I rarely measure, I just eyeball
        it.
      </p>
      <li>Toss, toss, toss!</li>
      <p>
        With the skillet still on a low stove, use 2 wooden spoons to toss the
        pasta vigorously for a minute. After 20 or 30 seconds of tossing, you’ll
        notice that the sauce in the skillet starts clinging to the pasta
        (thanks to the pasta cooking water!). The pasta is ready when the sauce
        is all stuck to the pasta rather than sitting in the skillet.
